"Negative feedback may suppress variation to improve collective foraging performance"

by Andreagiovanni Reina and James Marshall
(The University of Sheffield).

In the folder Gillespie, there is the Python code to run the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA). The zip file published_data.zip already contains the results generated with SSA to create the pictures in the paper. The file published_notebook.nb is a Mathematica notebook to create all the Figures of the paper and of the Supplementary Material.
